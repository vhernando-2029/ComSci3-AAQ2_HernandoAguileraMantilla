                Mental health is about how we think, feel, and act every day. It affects how we handle
                stress, make choices, and relate to other people. Just like physical health, mental
                health is important at every age.

                Everyone has moments when they feel lost, overwhelmed, or unsure of their worth. But your
                feelings, your story, and your presence in this world genuinely matter. You deserve care,
                support, and the chance to understand what you’re going through.

            <h3>Your Feelings Are Valid</h3>
            <p>No emotion you feel is “too much” or “not enough.” Your experiences are real, and acknowledging them is a brave first step toward healing.</p>

        <div class="lm-card">
            <h3>You are not alone</h3>
            <p>Many people struggle with anxiety, depression, ADHD, or emotional stress — but no one has to face it alone. Connection can be healing.</p>

        <div class="lm-card">
            <h3>You deserve support</h3>
            <p>Seeking help isn’t a sign of weakness. It means you care enough about yourself to grow. Support is always available.</p>

        <div class="lm-card">
            <h3>There is hope</h3>
            <p>Healing isn’t always quick, but it is possible. Every small step adds up. You matter because your future holds meaning.</p>
